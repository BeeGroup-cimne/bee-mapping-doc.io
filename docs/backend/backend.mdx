In order to run the platform successfully, we need to configure the backend and client part. First of all we have to install all
the dependencies said in [section](../intro.mdx).

# Getting Started
## Install Python Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configure environment variables

:::danger

Please, avoid sharing the `.env` file, it contains sensible data such as database configuration. 

:::

```shell title=".env"
FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=production

SECRET_KEY=
SERVER_HOSTNAME=
SERVER_PORT=

JWT_SECRET_KEY=
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES=
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES=

MONGO_URI=

ADMIN_EMAIL=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=

```

:::info

An easy way to generate secret keys is using the follow command line

```shell
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
```

:::


## Run Server
Set the correct `<localhost>` and `<port>` variables.

```shell
flask run --host=<localhost> --port=<port>
```

## Ontology

The ontology that the backend may use is in `RDF/XML Syntax` format, in addition you have some example in the folder `examples/ontologies`.
