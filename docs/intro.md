# Data Mapping Tool

`Data Mapping Tool` is a web platform that allows users to load their tabular data as `CSV` and map it according to the ontology
selected. In addition, this platform generates a `YARRRML` file as output. Nevertheless, you can transform the result to
other formats such as `RML`, `R2RML` or `RDF`.
